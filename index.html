        <h1>A Harrowing Tale of Cheryl Schaefer: Part Human, Part Program</h1>
        <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
	It was blustery and cold.<br> Cheryl was up..and...<em>thriving.</em><br>
	She was missing her left shoe, and her toes were blue.<br> She broke into
	 a cold sweat of existentialism.<br> "Am I even human?", she thought, as she stubbed <br>
	frozen toes on her half-empty bottle of peach schnapps and fell into an infinite loop.</p>
